Each line should calculate its own startX based on its own length.\n\n2. beams: Optimize performance by reducing character count. Currently creates width*height characters (12k+ on fullscreen). Consider sparse sampling or only creating characters where beams are active.\n\n3. beams: Verify rendering across entire screen dimensions.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-11T18:28:46.356446323+11:00","updated_at":"2025-11-11T18:28:46.356446323+11:00"}
