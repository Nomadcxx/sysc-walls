Sparse sampling (3x3 spacing) - reduces from 12k+ to ~1.3k characters\n2. Reduced beam activation (1-2 groups vs 1-5)\n3. Increased activation delay (3 vs 1)\n4. Reduced beam speeds (30-80 rows, 20-50 cols)\n\nTotal performance gain: ~9x fewer allocations\nBeams now renders smoothly at fullscreen.\n\nCommitted to sysc-Go master: 268508c","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-11T18:28:46.356446323+11:00","updated_at":"2025-11-11T19:02:14.110519786+11:00"}
