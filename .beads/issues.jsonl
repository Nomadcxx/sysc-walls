Need to use sysc-Go library directly. Challenge: sysc-Go animations use mixed APIs - some take (width, height, palette), others use Config structs (Aquarium, Beams, BeamText, Decrypt, Pour, Print). Solution: Create wrapper layer that handles both API styles and maintains state between frames. This will eliminate process spawning overhead and dramatically improve performance.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-30T14:16:32.850110455+11:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T16:43:50.619241925+11:00"}
